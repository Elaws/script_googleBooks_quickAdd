## Description

This script allows you to easily insert a book note into your Obsidian vault using [Quickadd plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) by @chhoumann. **Now also works on Mobile (make sure you use latest QuickAdd) !**
Possible to query book using :
- a book title or ISBN (10 or 13). 
- (optional) author name

It's also possible to query book using author name only (just skip book title prompt).

The `(i)` prefix in search suggestions indicates that an image is available for this book.

We use Google Books API to get the book information.

An API KEY for Google Books is needed to use this script : it can be obtained [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials). Steps to obtain this key are detailed below (see [How to obtain Google Book's API key](#how-to-obtain-google-books-api-key)).

## Disclaimer

The script and this tutorial are based on [Macro_MovieAndSeriesScript.md](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd/blob/master/docs/Examples/Macro_MovieAndSeriesScript.md) by @chhoumann.

**Please never run a script that you don't understand. I cannot and will not be liable for any damage caused by the use of this script. Regularly make a backup of your Obsidian's vault !**

0. Make sure you use latest Quickadd version (at least 0.5.1) !
1. Save the [script](https://github.com/Elaws/script_googleBooks_quickAdd/releases) to your vault somewhere. Make sure it is saved as a JavaScript file, meaning that it has the `.js` at the end.
2. Create a new template in your designated templates folder. Example template is provided below.
3. Open the Macro Manager by opening the QuickAdd plugin settings and clicking `Manage Macros`.
4. Create a new Macro - you decide what to name it.
5. Add the user script to the command list.
6. Add a new Template step to the macro. This will be what creates the note in your vault. Settings are as follows:
    1. Set the template path to the template you created.
    2. Enable File Name Format and use `{{VALUE:fileName}}` as the file name format. You can specify this however you like. The `fileName` value is the name of book without illegal file name characters.
    3. The remaining settings are for you to specify depending on your needs.
7. Click on the cog icon to the right of the script step to configure the script settings. This should allow you to enter the API key you got from Google Books API. **Make sure no spaces are inserted before or after the key !**
8. Go back out to your QuickAdd main menu and add a new Macro choice. Again, you decide the name. This is what activates the macro.
9. Attach the Macro to the Macro Choice you just created. Do so by clicking the cog âš™ icon and selecting it.

You can now use the macro to create notes with book information in your vault !

publish-date AS "Publish date",
("![coverImg|100](" + Cover + ")") as Cover,
rating AS "Rating",
AverageRating AS "Average Rating",
Maturity AS "Maturity Rating",
PageCount AS "Page Count",
BookDescription AS "Book Description",
Genre,
